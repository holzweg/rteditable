rteditable Inline Editor jquery plugin
=======

What is rteditable?
----------------------------------------------------------
This jquery- plugin allows you to easily edit any kind of html elements on your website.

&rarr; This extension is for those of you that want to implement an extreamly easy-to-use way of content management.

How does it work?
----------------------------------------------------------
This jquery- plugin can be fired on elements that match a certain selector (like many other jquery plugins). The easiest way to fire the editor interface is to do something like this:

        $().ready(function() {
            $('[data-slug]').rteditable({
                url: "backend.php"
            });
        });

The data-slug attribute can be placed on any html node, and has two uses:

        1) It's value will be sent to the backend url, to allow the mapping of the translated value to it's source
        2) HTML nodes that have the same slug, will be updated in-place. That means that editing a node with slug "heading1"
           will automatically update it's sister nodes (that also have the slug "heading1")... live...

Installation:
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Clone this repository into your web root

2. Create a new database and import the sql dump found in

        {rteditable}/demo-sql/rteditable.sql

3. Update the index.php file to update your database credentials

        {rteditable}/demo/index.php (line 2)

4. Kick back and enjoy! (:
